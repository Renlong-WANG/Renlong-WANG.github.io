## Research Projects


#### Project 1: Ordinal Priority Approach and Its Extension in MCDM (Apr. 2023 - Present)

- Wang, R. et.al. propose partial ordinal priority approach (POPA) and maximum entropy ordinal priority approach (MEOPA) based on ordinal priority approach.
- Future work will be devoted to the extension of POPA and MEOPA for fuzzy decision making, grey decision making, large-scale group decision making, scenario robust decision making and criterion interaction decision making.

#### Project 2: Meta-Network Modeling and Analysis in Emergency Management (Sep. 2023 - Present)

- Wang, R. et.al. propose an emergency response plan modeling framework based on meta-network for cross-organizational heterogeneous collaboration identification.
- Future work will focus on resilience simulation and assessment of emergency organization, and organizational structure optimization under the meta-networking modeling framework.
