# About Me
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/lifephoto.jpg" width="600" height="460">
<br>
Here is **Renlong Wang (王人龙)**.

I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Industrial Engineering at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), advised by Dr. [<font color='#3366CC'>Mingang Gao</font>](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0028787) from CAS, with an expected graduation date of June 2026. Before that, I received my B.S. in Civil Engineering from Nanjing Tech University (NJTECH) in 2023, advised by Dr. [<font color='#3366CC'>Lingzhi Li</font>](https://cce.njtech.edu.cn/info/1098/3647.htm). I am also fortunate to collaborate with Dr. [<font color='#3366CC'>Endong Wang</font>](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/endong-wang/index.php) from SUNY-ESF and Dr. [<font color='#3366CC'>Xueyan Shao</font>](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0058756) from CAS. My current research focuses on developing new methods for modeling, evaluation, and optimization of complex systems under uncertainty in operational parameters and preferences, based on operations research, network analysis, and system simulation techniques, with application to operational decision-making and infrastructure resilience.

<br>

**<font color='red'>[Highlight]</font> I am looking for PhD position in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) or Construction Engineering Management (CEM) to start in 2026 Fall. Contact me if you have any leads!**
