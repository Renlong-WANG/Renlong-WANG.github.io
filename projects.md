## Research Projects


#### Project 1: Muti-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) <br> (Apr. 2023 - Present)

- Wang, R. et.al. propose partial ordinal priority approach (POPA) and maximum entropy ordinal priority approach (MEOPA) based on ordinal priority approach.
- Future work will be devoted to the extension of POPA and MEOPA for fuzzy decision making, grey decision making, large-scale group decision making, scenario robust decision making and criterion interaction decision making. 
<br>

#### Project 2: Meta-Network Modeling and Analysis in Emergency Management <br> (Sept. 2023 - Present)

- Wang, R. et.al. propose an emergency response plan modeling framework based on meta-network for cross-organizational heterogeneous collaboration identification.
- Future work will focus on resilience simulation and assessment of emergency organization, and organizational structure optimization under the meta-networking modeling framework.

#### Project 3: Infrastructure Resilience Simulation and Assessment <br> (Jul. 2021 - Sept. 2023)

- Hosting Nation-level Student Research Training Program: Measuring Hospital Resilience at the Nexus of Power-water-firefighting-space (PWFS) System: Cellular Automata-based Approach.
- Participating in National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Program: The Panoramic Evaluation and Intelligent Improvement of Operational Resilience for Urban Public Service Facilities.
- Participating in Natural Science Research Program for Jiangsu Universities: Research on Dynamic Assessment and Intelligent Monitoring of Operational Resilience of Large Public Service Facilities.
<br>


#### Project 4: Construction Safety Management <br> (Sept. 2020 - Aug. 2021)

- Hosting School-level Student Research Training Program: Safety Risk Evaluation of Prefabricated Building Construction.
